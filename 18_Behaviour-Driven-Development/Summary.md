- BDD format -> user story, As a [X] i want [Y] so that [Z], scenario, Given When Then. 
- Gherkin BDD language : Meta (search feature for users), Narrative (as a user), Scenario (search laptop).

1. write story : gherkinsntax (giveb, when, than)
2. map steps to java : configure steps script and validation 
3. configure stories : combine stories and steps
4. run stories : intellij IDEA, maven
